**Data Science Portfolio**

Showcasing work that I have done for class projects, along with projects done by myself.

**Python:**

---
Worked in a team of three, utilized Yelp’s, Google’s Geocoder, and GeoDB web API’s to gather data. This data was gathered in JSON, and converted into python lists. Then, a six-table database was created with 1,000 rows. Lastly, Visualizations were created using Matplotlib.

Yelp API: businesses name, city, rating, address, phone number, total reviews, price range, and category.

Geocoder: city population, elevation, and timezone

Google Map: Latitude and Longitude

Data was gathered for the most populated 100 US cities, along with top rated restuarants.
